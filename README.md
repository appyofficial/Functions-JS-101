# Javascript Projects
Collection of pure vanilla javascript projects, specially for beginners. I really believe the best way to learn to code it to build, break and repeat. I found there are so many tutorials but there are very few projects. Therefore, I decided to make this repo as collections of vanilla js projects.

# What projects are there?
