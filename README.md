# Javascript Projects
Collection of pure vanilla javascript projects. I really believe the best way to learn to code it to build, break and repeat. I found there are so many tutorials but there are very few projects. Therefore, I decided to make this repo as collections of vanilla js projects for my own practice and also if there's someone want to use it or improve it. they are welcome.

# What projects are there?


## The Vanilla Clock
The vanilla clock is a clock which is made by pure javascript, html and css. It changes the background according to the time of the day, says good morning to the user by asking their name.

## The Read List
The read list is to save the books you want to read later. It takes book's name, author name and book Id number. Javascript, html and bootstrap has been used.

## The Popup Modal
The popup box modal, a really simple and easy to make with the help of Javascript DOM, HTML 5, CSS. Good for someone learning dom on how to select elements by their ID, Class etc.


## The Weather app
Weather app which ask user for their location and with the help of DarkSky api, it delivers weather status like tempreture, condition of the current status. Design was not a priority, but i will update css file to make it look nice later.
